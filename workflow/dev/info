Each record of MotEvo results file consist of 2 lines with the format:
[binding position*] [strand] [binding posterior*] [PWM ID] [binding region]
[binding sequence] [binding energy] [FASTA record ID]

Binding energy should be positive, if it is not then the posterior is probably very low and the user should increase the min posterior cutoff.
Such records should not be taken into account.
Multiple records of a given motif might correspond to one input sequence, if more than one binding site has been found
BUT if two sites overlap only the one with the higher posterior is reported by MotEvo!
